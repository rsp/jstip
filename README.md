JavaScript: The Irreducible Parts
=================================

[https://github.com/rsp/jstip](https://github.com/rsp/jstip)
([readme](https://github.com/rsp/jstip#readme))

This is a try to find a minimal, irreducible set of JavaScript features
that can be used to write useful programs.

This is not an attempt to produce anything even remotely practical.
If any feature of the language can be avoided ad reimplemented using a smaller
set of features making programs run million times slower, it will be.

...

This is work in progress - more to come.
